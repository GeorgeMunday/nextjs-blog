# Building a Blog with Pure Markdown

Ever wondered how to build a blog without the complexity? Here's my secret: **it's just Markdown files in a folder**.

## The Magic Formula

No database. No CMS. No complicated setup. Just:

- A folder of `.md` files
- Next.js for rendering
- Git for version control

## How It Actually Works

### 1. File Structure

```
/posts
  ├── why-markdown-wins.md
  ├── nextjs-tutorial.md
  └── coding-tips.md
```

### 2. Frontmatter Magic

Each post starts with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "My Amazing Post"
tags: ["markdown", "nextjs", "tutorial"]
---
```

### 3. The Build Process

1. Next.js scans the `/posts` directory
2. Parses Markdown and frontmatter
3. Generates static HTML pages
4. Deploys blazing-fast content

## Why This Approach Wins

### Simplicity

- Write in any text editor
- Version control with Git
- No database maintenance
- Zero security vulnerabilities

### Performance

- Static file serving
- Instant page loads
- Perfect Lighthouse scores
- Excellent SEO

### Developer Experience

```typescript
// How easy is the code? This easy:
const getPost = (slug: string) => {
  const file = fs.readFileSync(`posts/${slug}.md`);
  return matter(file);
};
```
