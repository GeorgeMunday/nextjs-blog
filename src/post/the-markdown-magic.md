Ever wondered why so many developers use **Markdown** for their blogs?

When I started building this site, I didnâ€™t want to spend hours messing with a CMS or bloated web editor. I wanted something **clean, portable, and version-controlled** â€” something that would live comfortably inside a Git repository.

Thatâ€™s where **Markdown** came in.

Each post you see here is just a `.md` file sitting in a `/posts` folder. When the site builds, those files are automatically turned into beautiful web pages.

Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s awesome:

- ðŸ§  I can focus on writing, not formatting.
- ðŸ’¾ My posts are just text files â€” easy to back up or move.
- ðŸ›  It integrates perfectly with static site generators like **Next.js**, **Astro**, or **Hugo**.

If youâ€™ve ever thought of starting a blog, try writing your next post in Markdown first â€” you might never go back.
